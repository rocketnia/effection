@title{Effection}

Effection is a highly experimental library for managing side effects in Racket. It supports a certain programming style that's almost pure, but which also has the ability to introduce handlers for custom side effects.

For now, Effection offers no public modules. The modules it once offered have been moved to Interconfection.
